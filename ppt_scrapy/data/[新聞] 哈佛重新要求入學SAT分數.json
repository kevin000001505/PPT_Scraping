Deming and co-author John N. Friedmanpublished last year, that stated that standardized tests are an importanttool in identifying \"promising students at less-well-resourced high schools,particularly when paired with other academic credentials.\"However, the university emphasized that standardized test scores are just oneaspect of the application, and that the admission committee carefullyconsiders each application as a whole before making a decision.“Test scores can provide important information about a student’sapplication,” William R. Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aidsaid in a statement. “However, they represent only one factor among many asour admissions committee considers the whole person in making its decisions.\"Harvard, like other schools across the country, had dropped the SAT and otherstandardized testing requirements in June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemicthat had limited access to testing. Submission of scores remained optionalfor subsequent application cycles, with the Class of 2028 being the fourthfor which students were able to apply without submitting test scores.如許多學校一樣，哈佛在2020取消SAT，說因為COVID\"Through the admissions process, we seek to recruit students from all partsof our nation and across the world, from many walks of life, to bring withthem to Harvard a universe of new questions, perspectives, and hopes for thefuture,\" Hoekstra said.In February earlier this year, Yale and Dartmouth both announced theirdecision to reinstate the standardized testing requirement for undergraduateapplicants.二月耶魯與達斯茅斯重啟SAT要求Dartmouth College in a statement said that the “test-optional admissionpolicy” implemented in June 2020 was never meant to become standardpractice, but rather a “short-term” pause in light of current events. Theuniversity was the first Ivy League institution to make this move.Both Yale and Dartmouth had said that their decision to reinstate testing hadcome after several years of research and study, with Yale pointing to datasuggesting “test scores are the single greatest predictor of a student’sfuture Yale grades.”Brown, meanwhile, announced in March its decision to reinstate standardizedtesting for the Class of 2029.布朗三月宣布重啟5.完整新聞連結 (或短網址)不可用YAHOO、LINE、MSN等轉載媒體:", "--"], "post_comment": [{"comment_author": "twmacaron", "comment_date": ["04/13", "01:40"], "comment_content": "媽的笑死怎麼不黑人+35%"}, {"comment_author": "darkbrigher", "comment_date": ["04/13", "01:44"], "comment_content": "繼續卡阿 硬要收不符標準的黑人"}, {"comment_author": "Lowpapa", "comment_date": ["04/13", "01:44"], "comment_content": "黑人+35%"}, {"comment_author": "gowaa", "comment_date": ["04/13", "01:46"], "comment_content": "該罵爆他們歧視了吧？"}, {"comment_author": "v21638245", "comment_date": ["04/13", "01:47"], "comment_content": "卡亞裔學校就是會爛掉"}, {"comment_author": "koexe", "comment_date": ["04/13", "01:58"], "comment_content": "?????"}, {"comment_author": "TheDraggers", "comment_date": ["04/13", "02:07"], "comment_content": "收一堆廢物自食惡果"}, {"comment_author": "MK47", "comment_date": ["04/13", "02:09"], "comment_content": "然後亞裔分數要比較高才錄取"}, {"comment_author": "rejuvenation", "comment_date": ["04/13", "02:37"], "comment_content": "笑死 自己愛騎士別人 幹嘛愛拖頂尖"}, {"comment_author": "rejuvenation", "comment_date": ["04/13", "02:38"], "comment_content": "學府下水啦  邏輯有待加強 人家重"}, {"comment_author": "rejuvenation", "comment_date": ["04/13", "02:38"], "comment_content": "啟SAT 其中原因是因為 收到比以往"}, {"comment_author": "rejuvenation", "comment_date": ["04/13", "02:38"], "comment_content": "更多海外申請 而SAT能夠在「海量」"}, {"comment_author": "rejuvenation", "comment_date": ["04/13", "02:38"], "comment_content": "申請者中進行初步篩選"}, {"comment_author": "tenderwind", "comment_date": ["04/13", "03:44"], "comment_content": "哈佛有什麼了不起，爛哈佛 (比6)"}]}
